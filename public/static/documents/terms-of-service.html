We only provide the interface and software but have no control over your blockchain interactions and do not endorse any specific actions. All the transactions occur on a blockchain which is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes (&ldquo;</span><span class="c7">Blockchain Networks</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;) that we do not own, control, or operate. We are not responsible for the services provided by third parties, the execution of the transactions, or any other actions of such third parties. We reserve the right to make changes to the Interface, including adding, modifying, or discontinuing products or features. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>Products and Features. The Interface integrates decentralized protocols and offers you access to numerous liquidity sources across multiple chains. The Interface may include other products and/or features added for the purposes of user experience development and improvement, including those for the informational, security, and entertainment purposes, which are not intended to affect the main purpose of the Interface described above. We only provide you with access to the relevant interface and software and neither have control over your interactions with the blockchain nor encourage you to perform any. Any interaction performed by you via the Interface remains your sole responsibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Interfaces are non-custodial tools that enable users to interact with the Protocol by providing web or mobile-based access. Through the Interfaces, users can declare desired outcomes (Intents) on various public blockchains, including but not limited to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana. These Intents are broadcast to a decentralized network of AI-driven and human-operated Solvers that independently analyze and compete to execute the Intents through optimal pathways across supported blockchains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Interfaces are &nbsp;designed to simplify blockchain interactions by allowing users, services, or AI agents to declare high-level outcomes they wish to achieve, rather than specifying the technical steps required. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Interfaces revolve around the concept of &quot;intents,&quot; which are structured declarations containing key details such as the initiator&#39;s NEAR account ID, the type of intent (e.g., token swap, transfer), source assets and amounts, desired outcomes, unique identifiers for tracking, and optional constraints like deadlines or minimum outputs. These intents are broadcasted to a Solver Network, where Solvers analyze and compete to provide the best execution plan. Once a user approves a Solver&#39;s quote, the Intent is executed via a smart contract on NEAR (intents.near), which handles the transaction&mdash;including cross-chain operations if necessary&mdash;while ensuring state changes are verified and reported back to the originator. This abstraction streamlines complex blockchain processes into an intuitive and efficient user experience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Interfaces are distinct from the Protocol and are one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. </span><span>The Company</span><span>&nbsp;does not control or operate any version of the Protocol on any blockchain network. By using the Interfaces, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital assets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. </span><span>When users pay fees for trades, and/or any Slippage, those fees may accrue to Solvers, Liquidity Providers and Relayers for the Protocol.</span><span>&nbsp;As a general matter, Solvers, L</span><span>iquidity providers and Relayers</span><span>&nbsp;are independent third parties. The Protocol was initially deployed on the NEAR blockchain </span><span>enabling</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;cross-chain functionality through Omni Bridge and any independent third party bridge. These bridges facilitate asset transfers between NEAR and supported networks (e.g., Bitcoin, Eth, Arbitrum, Base, Solana and others).</span></p><p class="c0"><span>To access the Interfaces, you must use a non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that wallet provider. We do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to our Interfaces, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Solvers are independent actors, and Company does not:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">(a) Guarantee optimal pricing or execution;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>(b)</span><span>&nbsp;Assess </span><span class="c1">Solvers&rsquo; reliability or security;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>(c) Insure against losses from Solver errors, collusion, or malicious acts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Solver Network includes AI-driven, </span><span>algorithmic-driven</span><span>&nbsp;and human-operated Solvers. AI Solvers may exhibit limitations including algorithmic biases, unpredictable behaviors under certain conditions, or optimization approaches that prioritize different factors than you might expect. The Company does not develop, control, or validate the decision-making processes of individual Solvers and assumes no responsibility for their performance or outcomes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>To the extent that you elect to conduct transactions in connection with the Interfaces, all transactions are conducted between you and the relevant third party (Solver Network) and the Company is not a party to them.

To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you acknowledge and understand that you should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information listed on the Interfaces are your sole responsibility. No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the site or otherwise when using the </span><span>Interfaces</span><span class="c1">.
